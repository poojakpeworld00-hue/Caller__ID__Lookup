/**
 * Gates a launcher gesture behind an interstitial or a promo link, then runs the gesture's action.
 *
 * Covers the two side panels and launching an app from the drawer, configured per gesture from
 * `launcher.gestures` — see [LauncherAdsConfig].
 *
 * ### The gate, in order
 *
 * 1. `inter_enabled` off → run the action, no promo. An unfetched launcherConfig lands here, which is why
 *    that flag defaults false: the launcher must behave exactly as shipped until someone turns a
 *    placement on deliberately.
 * 2. Counter below `inter_counter` → increment and run the action. "Show on every Nth gesture",
 *    `0` meaning every time.
 * 3. Otherwise `url_enabled` → open the promo link; else show the interstitial.
 *
 * A promo link and an ad are alternatives for the same slot, never both — a single gesture must not
 * cost the user an ad *and* a browser trip.
 *
 * ### The action always runs
 *
 * Every path ends in [action], including a no-fill, a closed gate, a missing browser and an SDK
 * exception, and the callback is latched so it runs exactly once. Tapping an app in the drawer has
 * to launch that app; an ad that fails must never turn the tap into nothing.
 *
 * ### Frequency is counted here, not twice
 *
 * Each placement owns its counter, so the ad goes out with the AAR's own `interAdSkipCounter`
 * already satisfied by this gate. Running both would multiply into a spacing neither value
 * describes — the same rule the onboarding funnel follows.
 *
 * Counters are process-lifetime and per gesture: they describe "how many of *these* gestures since
 * the last ad", so carrying them across a cold start would describe nothing the user experienced,
 * and sharing one across gestures would make each one's spacing depend on the others' traffic.
