 * The launcher's ad slots, as seen from the launcher side.

 * and it stays in the module. It never decides *how* one is filled: every app wires its own SDK,
 * its own unit ids and its own consent, so each call here is a request the host may quietly ignore.
 *
 * An app with no ads passes [NoOp] (or nothing), and every launcher surface still works — the
 * frames simply stay GONE.
 *
 * Implementations must be safe to call before the ad SDK has finished initialising. The launcher
 * asks for its inline slots during view setup, which on a cold start is earlier than most SDKs are
 * ready; dropping the request there leaves a permanent blank gap, so defer it instead.
