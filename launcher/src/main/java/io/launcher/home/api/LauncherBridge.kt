/**
 * Everything the launcher needs from the app it is embedded in.
 *
 * Every method has a default, so a host that wants a plain launcher implements nothing at all and
 * passes no bridge. The methods are *pulled* — the launcher asks at the moment it needs the answer,
 * never caching it — so a host may change its mind at runtime (a purchase completes, a theme flips,
 * a config lands) and the next draw already reflects it. That is also why this is an interface of
 * functions rather than a data class of values: a value handed over at install time is a snapshot
 * that goes stale the first time anything changes.
 *
 * Nothing here may hand the launcher an Activity or a View. [panelFragment] returns a fresh
 * instance per call for the same reason: the launcher outlives any one screen of the host.
