/**
 * One place that owns the first-run route, so the caller-ID screens and the launcher screens
 * agree on where the user is headed.
 *
 * The sequence itself comes from Remote Config — `launcher_ads.onboarding.order` — and
 * defaults to the flow this app shipped with:
 *
 *     Splash
 *       └─ Welcome (notifications + phone state)
 *            └─ Set as default launcher?
 *                 ├─ allowed  → Home screen        (with skip_rest_on_grant, the default)
 *                 └─ skipped  → Intro (3 pages) → Language → Home screen
 *
 * Reorder it, drop a screen, or list `set_default` twice to ask again at the end; see
 * `docs/launcher-ads-config.md`. "Home screen" is the launcher's [HomeBoardActivity], not the
 * caller-ID app's own home — that one is a swipe right away from here.
 *
 * How far the sequence has got is kept in `LauncherPrefs.onboardingStep`, an index into the resolved
 * order. A cold start that finds onboarding unfinished restarts it from the top, exactly as
 * the hardcoded flow did.
