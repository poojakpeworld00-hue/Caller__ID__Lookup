     * rather than starting the Activity directly. Two reasons:
     *
     *  - The system re-establishes the home task itself, with the right activity type. Starting a
     *    default-affinity Activity into that task by hand is the trap that stopped the post-call
     *    screen from ever appearing (see `taskAffinity=""` in the manifest).
     *  - `LaunchGateActivity` also carries the package's default affinity, so `CLEAR_TASK` on it would
     *    clear the *home* task and leave the splash rooted in it.
     *
     * A generic HOME intent normally risks handing the user to whichever launcher is default —
     * the reason [com.callerid.number.lookup.home.screen.AppHomeActivity] deliberately avoids it — but in
     * this branch we are that launcher, so it can only land here.
