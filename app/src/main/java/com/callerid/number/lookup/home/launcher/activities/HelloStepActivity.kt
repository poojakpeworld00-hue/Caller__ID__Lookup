/**
 * First launcher onboarding screen, shown once.
 *
 * The screen used to carry a toggle per permission; the design it is now built to has none,
 * so Continue hands off to [PermitEngine], which asks for whatever `permission_engine` has
 * configured for this Activity — notifications and phone state — in priority order, honouring
 * each rule's delay and skipping anything already granted or not applicable on this SDK.
 *
 * The engine matches rules by Activity simple name, so `"HelloStepActivity"` has to
 * appear in the `activities` list of each rule in Remote LauncherPrefs. With no rule targeting this
 * screen the engine completes immediately and Continue simply moves on — which is also what
 * happens once every permission is already granted.
 *
 * Declining is not a dead end: the flow always continues to whatever `onboarding.order` puts
 * next (the "set as default launcher" step, unless Remote LauncherPrefs reordered it), and the
 * permissions stay reachable later from Settings. Skip goes to the same place without asking
 * for anything.
