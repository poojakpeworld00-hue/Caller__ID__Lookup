 * Immutable data models for the global Permission Engine.

 * A [PermitRule] is one entry parsed out of the `permission_engine`
 * Firebase Remote Config object. A [PermitSpec] is the engine's static
 * knowledge of *how* to request a given OS permission (its Android permission
 * string and the SDK level below which it is implicitly granted).
 *
 * To support a brand-new permission in the future you only add a
 * [PermitSpec] to [PermitKit.CATALOG] and reference its key from
 * Remote Config — no other code changes are required.
