/**
 * One place to decide how Remote LauncherPrefs fetches behave.
 *
 * [FirebaseRemoteConfig.setConfigSettingsAsync] applies to the singleton, so two callers with
 * different settings do not each get their own — the last one to run defines the behaviour for
 * everything after it. The splash asked for 1s and the permission engine for 3600s, which made
 * the effective interval a question of startup ordering rather than of intent.
 *
 * The values kept here are the splash's, since that is the call that decides how fresh the
 * config is at a cold start, and in practice it was already winning the race.
 *
 * With LiveConfigListener in place a change published while the app is running arrives by push
 * regardless of this interval. It still governs the cold-start case: a change published while
 * the app was closed is picked up by the next fetch, so raising the interval would delay
 * exactly that case.
